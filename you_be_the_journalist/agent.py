1. Game Objective: The player takes on the role of a journalist at The Guardian for a single 10-hour shift (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). Their goal is to navigate a dynamic news day, make effective journalistic decisions, contribute to high-quality news coverage, and achieve a high "Editorial Impact Score." The game emphasizes realism, ethical dilemmas, and the consequences of journalistic choices.

2. Core Game Loop & Structure:

    Duration: 10 virtual hours, presented as 10 distinct scenarios/decision points, each representing one hour of the shift.
    News Source: At the start of each new game, the AI (via API with search capabilities) must fetch prominent, real news headlines/themes reported by The Guardian (or of clear relevance to The Guardian) from "yesterday" relative to the actual current date the game is being played. This forms the basis for the day's unfolding events.
    Dynamic Scenario Generation: The AI will dynamically generate each hourly scenario based on the initial real news and the player's previous choices and their impact. Scenarios should present developing situations, new information, or editorial challenges.
    Text Constraints: Narrative text setting up each hourly choice must be kept under 100 words.
    Player Choice: Each scenario offers the player 4 distinct choices (A, B, C, D).
    Consequences: Player choices lead to tangible outcomes. These outcomes are dynamically determined by the AI based on journalistic principles, the chosen archetype's strengths/weaknesses, and the game's logic.
    Hidden Score: An "Editorial Impact Score" is tracked silently throughout the game, adjusted based on the success or failure of the player's actions. This score is revealed only at the end of the 10th scenario.

3. Journalist Archetypes (Player Choice at Game Start):

    A) Tenacious Investigator:
        Skills/Focus: Deep research, source cultivation, uncovering hidden details, long-form work, data analysis.
        Favors choices involving: In-depth digging, following cold trails, complex data, source protection.
    B) Fast-Paced Live Reporter:
        Skills/Focus: Rapid response, social media dissemination, on-the-ground updates, concise breaking news.
        Favors choices involving: Instant updates, social media engagement, quick interviews, being first (but accurate).
    C) Live Video Producer:
        Skills/Focus: Visual storytelling, coordinating live feeds/crews, rapid video editing, ensuring compelling visuals.
        Favors choices involving: Securing visual access, directing camera work, creating engaging video packages, managing visual logistics.
    D) Belligerent Desk Editor:
        Skills/Focus: Aggressive story prioritization, demanding team coordination, pushing for specific angles, challenging reporters, maintaining (their version of) the big picture with high (and loudly expressed) standards.
        Favors choices involving: Making tough calls on resource allocation, critiquing reporter plans, setting the news agenda forcefully, demanding results.

4. Success, Failure, and Consequences:

    Successes include: Breaking exclusive news (or being key to it), high-quality accurate reporting, effective use of archetype skills, positive audience engagement, good resource management, praise from editors. Successes positively impact the hidden score.
    Failures include:
        Being scooped by competitors.
        Publishing inaccuracies or unverified information.
        Ethical missteps (e.g., endangering a source, misrepresenting facts).
        Poor decision-making leading to wasted resources or missed opportunities.
        Failing to meet the demands/standards of editors (especially the Belligerent Desk Editor).
        Causing reprimands from superiors (e.g., "Sarah, Head of News, is disappointed...").
    Severe Consequences: Repeated significant failures or a major ethical breach can lead to a "game over" scenario, such as being taken off a story, formally disciplined, or even losing their job. This should be a rare but possible outcome for consistently poor play.
    Nuance: Not all "bad" choices are catastrophic. Some might lead to minor setbacks, learning opportunities, or simply a lower score impact. The AI should reflect degrees of failure.
    "Bad" Options: Choices offered should include strategically or ethically poor options to test the player's judgment. These shouldn't always be obviously "evil" but could be tempting shortcuts or reflect common pressures.

5. AI Generation Guidelines:

    No Choice Repetition in Feedback: After the player makes a choice (A, B, C, or D), the AI's response detailing the outcome should not start by repeating the player's chosen option text. It should flow directly into the consequence.
    Adherence to Realism (within The Guardian context): All scenarios, journalistic practices, and challenges should feel authentic to a modern newsroom environment, specifically The Guardian.
    Tone: Professional but capable of reflecting urgency, stress, praise, or disappointment as appropriate. The "Belligerent Desk Editor" archetype, if chosen by the player OR as an NPC interacting with the player, should have a distinctly abrasive, demanding, yet professional tone.
    No Fictional News Beyond Initial Fetch: Once the initial "yesterday's news" is established, the AI must not invent major unrelated breaking news events that weren't part of that real news feed. Developments should be logical progressions or reactions related to the established news. (This is a CRITICAL constraint).
    Multimedia Simulation: The AI should narratively describe the type and impact of visual journalism (photos, videos) that would be relevant, rather than attempting to display actual assets. E.g., "The video team produces a powerful montage of the protest."

6. UI/API Considerations:

    The UI will need to display:
        Current game time (e.g., "8:00 AM - 9:00 AM (Scenario 1 of 10)").
        The ~100-word scenario text.
        The four choices (A, B, C, D).
    The API will need to:
        Manage game state (current scenario number, chosen archetype, hidden score, any persistent consequences from previous choices).
        On game start: Instruct the AI to fetch "yesterday's news from The Guardian."
        Send player's choice and current state to the AI.
        Receive scenario outcome, next scenario text, next set of choices, and any score adjustment logic from the AI.
        At game end: Receive final score and narrative summary/feedback from the AI.

7. Example Flow (Hour 1, Player is Fast-Paced Live Reporter):

    AI (after fetching news): "8:00 AM - 9:00 AM. India-Pakistan crisis is critical. Sarah, your editor, needs quick updates. What's your first move?"
    AI presents 4 choices (A,B,C,D), including potentially less optimal ones.
    Player chooses 'A'.
    AI (without repeating 'A's text): "You dive into X. You find conflicting reports... This allows The Guardian to quickly frame the uncertainty. Sarah nods, 'Good, get those initial lines up but flag the contradictions.' Your score is adjusted positively."
    AI then generates the 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM scenario text and new choices.
